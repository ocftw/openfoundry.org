	<title>IDE.PHP</title>
	<link>https://www.openfoundry.org/en/resourcecatalog/Program-Development/Programming-Languages/php/Integrated-Development-Environment/idephp</link>
	<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size: 14.4px;">Ide.php is a web-based editor for quick development of server-side code. It offers a rapid prototyping environment, letting the user test and save snippets of code with minimal overhead.</span></p>
<p>Ide.php was primarily written for PHP, but has been extended to enable development in any server-side scripting language available on the server where it's running, like SSI, ASP, JSP, SSJS, even CGI!</p>
<p>Ide.php eliminates the need to use several separate programs (text editor, FTP program and web browser) for web development, since all work is done directly through the browser. This helps to shorten development time, and is also very helpful when learning a new scripting language, like PHP.</p>
