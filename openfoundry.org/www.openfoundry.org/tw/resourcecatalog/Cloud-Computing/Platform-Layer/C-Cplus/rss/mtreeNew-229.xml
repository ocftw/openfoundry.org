<p>Sector/Sphere supports distributed data storage, distribution, and processing over large clusters of commodity computers. Sector is a high performance, scalable, and secure distributed file system. Sphere is a high performance parallel data processing engine that can process Sector data files with very simple programming interfaces. Sector/Sphere can be broadly compared to Google's GFS/MapReduce stack, but differes several key design choices and provides better performance.</p>
