	<title>3GPP (Third Generation Partnership Project)</title>
	<link>https://www.openfoundry.org/en/resourcecatalog/Embedded/Wireless-Communication/Organizations/3gpp-third-generation-partnership-project</link>
	<description><![CDATA[<p>
<p>The original scope of 3GPP was to produce Technical Specifications and Technical Reports for a 3G Mobile System based on evolved GSM core networks and the radio access technologies that they support (i.e., Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (UTRA) both Frequency Division Duplex (FDD) and Time Division Duplex (TDD) modes).</p>
<p>The scope was subsequently amended to include the maintenance and development of the Global System for Mobile communication (GSM) Technical Specifications and Technical Reports including evolved radio access technologies (e.g. General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) and Enhanced Data rates for GSM Evolution (EDGE)).</p>

	<title>3GPP2 (The Third Generation Partnership Project 2)</title>
	<link>https://www.openfoundry.org/en/resourcecatalog/Embedded/Wireless-Communication/Organizations/3gpp2-the-third-generation-partnership-project-2</link>
	<description><![CDATA[<p>
<p>The Third Generation Partnership Project 2 (3GPP2) is:</p>
<p>a collaborative third generation (3G) telecommunications specifications-setting project</p>
<p>comprising North American and Asian interests developing global specifications for ANSI/TIA/EIA-41 Cellular Radiotelecommunication Intersystem Operations network evolution to 3G</p>
<p>and global specifications for the radio transmission technologies (RTTs) supported by ANSI/TIA/EIA-41.</p>
<p>3GPP2 was born out of the International Telecommunication Union's (ITU) International Mobile Telecommunications "IMT-2000" initiative, covering high speed, broadband, and Internet Protocol (IP)-based mobile systems featuring network-to-network interconnection, feature/service transparency, global roaming and seamless services independent of location. IMT-2000 is intended to bring high-quality mobile multimedia telecommunications to a worldwide mass market by achieving the goals of increasing the speed and ease of wireless communications, responding to the problems faced by the increased demand to pass data via telecommunications, and providing "anytime, anywhere" services.</p>
