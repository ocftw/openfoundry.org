	<description><![CDATA[<p>
<p>IronPython is an implementation of the Python programming language running under .NET and Silverlight. It supports an interactive console with fully dynamic compilation. It's well integrated with the rest of the .NET Framework and makes all .NET libraries easily available to Python programmers, while maintaining compatibility with the Python language. There also is Visual Studio tooling integration.</p>

	<title>Cx-Freeze</title>
	<link>https://www.openfoundry.org/en/resourcecatalog/Program-Development/Programming-Languages/python/Compiler/cx-freeze</link>
	<description><![CDATA[<p>
<p>cx_Freeze is a set of scripts and modules for freezing Python scripts into executables in much the same way that py2exe and py2app do. Unlike these two tools, cx_Freeze is cross platform and should work on any platform that Python itself works on. It requires Python 2.3 or higher since it makes use of the zip import facility which was introduced in that version.</p>
<p>Platform:Cross platform;           License:unknown</p>
