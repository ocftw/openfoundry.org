	<description><![CDATA[<p> </p>
<p>The research directions of our lab started from the computer architecture (CPU) and design automation (related CAD techniques) several years ago. These fields covered both hardware and software efforts. After years of research efforts, we have achieved many significant results that are recognized by both academy and industry. With such achievements, we are now ready to explore wider areas that are related to CPU's: the embedded systems.</p>
<p>We would like to address the design, integration, verification and use of hardware and software of the embedded systems. Our focuses may include (but are not limited to) high performance/low power/low cost processor design and optimization, SoC design for networking/ security/ multimedia, IP design, real-time operating systems, testing/debugging, system integration, and the related software/firmware techniques.</p>
