	<link>https://www.openfoundry.org/en/resourcecatalog/Enterprise/Workflow/adempiere-erp</link>
	<description><![CDATA[<p>
<p>The ADempiere project was created in September 2006 after a long running disagreement between ComPiere Inc., the developers of Compiere™, and the community that formed around that project. The community believed Compiere Inc. placed too much emphasis on the open source lock-in/commercial nature of the project, rather than the community sharing/enriching nature of the project, and after an impassioned discussion decided to split from Compiere™ giving birth to the ADempiere project.</p>
